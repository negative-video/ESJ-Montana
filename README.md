# ESJ-Montana

### Repository for all Montana Deaths of Despair work under Dr. Julie Silva and Dr. Sergii Skakun
Repo created and managed by Gerald Burkett

## Objective
Collect publicly-available data on environmental data that might correlate to [Case & Deaton's *Deaths of Despair*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190785/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism) within the region and use Geospatial Data Sciences techniques to compile data

## First Time Setup:
* Install the latest stable version of Python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Check installation by opening a command line and running `python3 --version`
* Check to make sure the package installer PIP is installed by running `python3 -m pip --version` in same command line
* Download UMD-DataScience repository and open within command line
* Create a virtual environment to keep packages contained. Run `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment, then run `source .venv/bin/activate` to initialize it now *and every time you want to run code after it closes.*
* Install necessary packages via command `python3 -m pip install requirements.txt`
* Run `jupyter notebook`. A web browser will open with a directory of all files. Choose which to open based on your task.
